<h1>Main</h1>
    <p>Here it is: the main body of the article, the sum of what could be years of work documented for the masses. This information includes an introduction to the study, the processes by which the experiments were conducted, the results obtained, and how these results relate to current scientific thought and practice. This section will explain the various parts of a regular scientific article and how they should be formatted. First, the purpose of headers and their coding is explained. From then on, topics are discussed as you would encounter them in a common article.</p>
    <p>At one time, books were produced as 'letter-books', where the body of text consisted of chapters of solid text, unillustrated. Where illustrations were provided, these were costly and so plates were inserted in sections, either at the end of the body matter, or grouped within the signatures. Development in printing in the early 20th century, and particularly developments in newspaper design and the incorporation of photographs, encouraged the development of the 'picture-book' where images were mixed in the text and formed part of the body matter itself (although in most cases, this was still outside the paragraphs of the typesetter's body text).</p>
